The core Personal Consumption Expenditures index showed July\u2019s prices (excluding volatile food and energy) rose 0.2% from the prior month, in line with expectations. With that metric confirmed, a very important thing has happened: The Fed\u2019s preferred inflation gauge is back to trending below 2%, the Fed\u2019s target and holy grail of the past two years.
